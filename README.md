# gRPC-demo

A chat system with a twist. Users can chat with each other similar to regular chat rooms. In addition, a special bot sends news flashes
to the chat room, making users aware of important events happening in the world.

A special monitoring console displays the events sent allowing admins to eversee the bot and users activity.

It has three main components:

1. **Chat Room**: Where users can chat with each other and register for the chat room they're interested in.
2. **News Bot**: A bot that sends news flashes to the chat room.
3. **Admin Console**: A monitoring console that displays the events sent by the bot and the users' activity.
